# Incomplete-remote-sensing-time-series-data-imputationfor-mapping-unknown-crop-types
This is the official implementation of *"Auxiliary data-driven imputation of incomplete remote-sensing time series for mapping unknown crop types"*. This a novel end-to-end framework for zero-shot crop classification with incomplete time-series data by jointly optimizing the incomplete time-series imputation task and zero-shot classification task.

## Current Status

- **Pre-trained Weights and Model Files**: We have made the pre-trained weights available for immediate use. You can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxWEfE3KSCf_yvX1azkRGv-i2B0pUGHY/view?usp=sharing) and start experimenting with the framework right away.
- **Codebase**: The current implementation includes the essential components to run the model. We are actively working on organizing and documenting the remaining parts of the codebase, which will be released as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates!
