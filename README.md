My Project Description Is All You Need

This is the official implementation of "My Project Description Is All You Need". This novel framework leverages both visual and semantic knowledge to extract time-series information for each project sample. By combining these insights, it pioneers zero-shot project classification across diverse regions, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for project monitoring.

Overview

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the application of zero-shot learning in project classification. And, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that exploits the time-series visual information of project samples as well as semantic knowledge in the form of novel time-series text descriptions. This repository provides the tools and resources to replicate our experiments, apply the framework to new regions, and explore its potential for project monitoring and beyond.

Current Status





Pre-trained Weights and Model Files: We have made the pre-trained weights available for immediate use. You can download them here and start experimenting with the framework right away.



Codebase: The current implementation includes the essential components to run the model. We are actively working on organizing and documenting the remaining parts of the codebase, which will be released as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates!
